                <h3>What is Tree Technologies?</h3>
              </header>
              <p>
                During my first year at Howard University, navigating the campus was extremely difficult.
                 From finding dining options to staying updated on events, there was no centralized system to 
                 access important information. After speaking with friends, I realized that this was a common struggle
                  for many students, and it became clear that something needed to change. Jayson Johnson and I decided 
                  to create a business to solve this problem, and that’s how Tree Technologies came to life.
              </p>
              <p>
                As co-founder and co-CEO of Tree Technologies, I focus on both the back-end development and business 
                operations of the Tree app. I lead team meetings, create schedules, and oversee the team’s progress.
                 The app centralizes crucial campus resources—dining, study spaces, event calendars, and 
                 key contacts—into one easy-to-use platform. Our goal is to make university life more organized 
                 and engaging, helping students stay informed and connected.


              </p>
              <p>
                Since launching the app, we’ve made incredible progress. We’ve seen the impact of our work as 
                hundreds of people have downloaded the app, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. 
                It’s exciting to see how students are using the app to improve their campus experience, and it 
                motivates us to continue developing and expanding Tree Technologies.

                  In Spring 2024, Tree Technologies won first place in the HU Empower Pitch Competition, securing $20,000 in funding.
                   The prize has been pivotal in helping us build and expand our app, turning our vision into a reality.

                <p>
                  We officially launched Rooted in September 2024. We believe that when students are deeply Rooted with their university, they have a 
                  strong foundation to grow academically and socially. Our app gives students the tools to navigate 
                  and thrive in their campus experience.
